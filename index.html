  <h1>Raksha Bandhan</h1>
  
  <p> <b>Raksha Bandhan 2022:</b> The special occasion of Raksha Bandhan is here. 
  <i>It's an opportunity to embrace sibling love and cherish the bond.</i> 
  <u>India as a whole celebrates it with great enthusiasm. </u>
  Raksha Bandhan is made more enjoyable by lovely rakhis, homemade sweets, presents, and puja.
  Any Hindu festival is incomplete without religious rituals. 
  In Raksha Bandhan prayers are offered to god and then sisters worship their brothers and tie rakhis on their wrists while chanting the Raksha Mantra. 
  It brings positivity and eliminate all the negative energies from his life. </p>
